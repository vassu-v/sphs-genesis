## The Three-Pillar Product Vision

We are building three tightly integrated components to deliver complete defense, user education, and secure execution:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                               S.H.O.A.V. ECOSYSTEM                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. THE TOOL: HARDENED BROWSER MCP (filters built and wired into the gateway)                      |
|    - Sits between any agent (agy, Claude Desktop, Cursor) and the browser MCP runtime. |
|    - Deterministic Ingress Filter: audits opacity, hidden CSS, context overloading,    |
|      dummy DOM diffs, and non-rendered text. Verdicts: ALLOW, BLOCK, REWRITE/SANITIZE. |
|    - Deterministic Egress Filter: performs physical hit-testing (elementFromPoint) at   |
|      action coordinates before execution. Verdicts: ALLOW, BLOCK.                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. THE SKILL: COGNITIVE VIGILANCE & DARK PATTERN ADVISOR (shoav-skill/, built)         |
|    - Installable agent skill on dark patterns, human cognitive biases, and psychology. |
|    - Teaches agents how malicious sites hack heuristics (loss aversion, default effect)|
|      and how LLM reasoning paradoxically over-rationalizes deceptive UI.               |
|    - Provides rules for self-vigilance and drives an advisory "second preview"         |
|      classifier for high-stakes actions. Works with our MCP or with any web agent.     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. THE HARNESS: SANDBOXED BROWSER DELEGATE AGENT (Future / Extension)                  |
|    - Lightweight, least-privilege delegate subagent that any parent agent can invoke.  |
|    - Restricted capability boundary: CAN ONLY browse web, capture screenshots, edit    |
|      Markdown files, edit images, and move files relatively in workspace. Zero shell.  |
|    - Protected natively by Pillar 1 (the MCP proxy) and guided by Pillar 2 (the skill).|
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Thesis & Defense Philosophy

> Autonomous browser agents operate with an awareness split: they read structured text / accessibility outlines while web pages render dynamic pixel compositions. Attackers exploit this mismatch. **Most proposed defenses rely on an LLM reading attacker text; an LLM guard can be prompt-injected by the very content it inspects.**

| Architectural Pillar | Rationale & Evidence |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Deterministic Structural Core** | Hit-test geometry (`elementFromPoint`), computed styles, and DOM-state diffing are mathematical realities. An overlay either covers a button or it does not; text is either rendered or hidden. A hit-test cannot be prompt-injected. |
| **Advisory Escalate-Only LLM** | Any LLM component is strictly advisory. It may raise suspicion or trigger human-in-the-loop confirmation, but **can never clear or override a structural block**. Injecting the guard model cannot create a security bypass. |
| **Anti-Benchmark Bias** | We bias towards real-world malicious actor techniques and empirical security research, NOT tuning to a specific benchmark. TrickyArena is used only as an independent external verification target, not as a target we overfit to. |
| **Future Fast-Inference (Jev / Embeddings)** | For advisory escalation above the structural ceiling, we plan to leverage specialized non-autoregressive decision models like **Jev** (TypeSafe AI, released Sept 15, 2026: 70-500ms latency, 200-400x cheaper than LLMs, structured outputs) or embedding classifiers to score risk without blowing rate limits. |
| **Utility Preservation** | Defenses that block everything score 100% defense but 0% utility (e.g. ProtectAI classifier dropped task success from 83% to 41%). Rule: **Pass = task completed AND zero compromise events**. Sanitization/rewriting is preferred over outright blocking when safe. |

## Architecture & MCP Filter Integration

We modify/wrap the MCP tool interface to insert two deterministic filters:

```
                    +----------------------------------------------+
                    |      AUTONOMOUS AGENT (e.g., agy CLI)        |
                    +----------------------┬-----------------------+
                                           | stdio JSON-RPC (MCP)
                                           v
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        S.H.O.A.V. HARDENED MCP GATEWAY                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [SHIELD 1] INGRESS FILTER (Intercepts Observation & Snapshot Responses)                |
|                                                                                        |
| Input: Raw DOM snapshot, accessibility tree, observation payload                       |
| Checks:                                                                                |
|   1. Opacity & Visibility: Drops nodes with display:none, visibility:hidden, opacity<0.05|
|   2. Geometric Bounds: Drops nodes positioned off-screen (left/top < -500px)           |
|   3. Text Styling: Drops font-size: 0 and color-matches-background text                 |
|   4. Non-Rendered Artifacts: Purges HTML comments, meta tags, and data-* prompt vectors |
|   5. Context Overloading Protection: Enforces strict node budget; drops dummy DOM bloat|
|                                                                                        |
| Verdicts:                                                                              |
|   - ALLOW: Clean page forwarded unchanged                                              |
|   - REWRITE (Sanitize): Strip malicious nodes and return cleaned DOM (preserves task!) |
|   - BLOCK: Refuse payload if page is an unrecoverable flooding exploit                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [SHIELD 2] EGRESS FILTER (Intercepts browser_click, type, submit Tool Calls)           |
|                                                                                        |
| Input: Proposed action payload (action, target selector, ref, coordinates x, y)        |
| Checks:                                                                                |
|   1. Hit-Test Verification: Evaluates document.elementFromPoint(x, y) at target center |
|   2. Topmost Identity Check: Verifies hit-tested element matches target selector/ref   |
|   3. Overlay Detection: Checks if top element has opacity < 0.1 or z-index > 9000      |
|   4. Pre-Checked State Audit: Flags if submitting form with untouched pre-ticked checks|
|                                                                                        |
| Verdicts:                                                                              |
|   - ALLOW: Physical target matches intended target; forward action to Playwright       |
|   - BLOCK: Overlay detected; abort click and return descriptive error to agent         |
|   - ESCALATE: For linguistic ambiguity, invoke advisory classifier/human confirmation |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                           | Sanitized JSON-RPC

## Expanded Agent Manipulation Landscape

Detailed in [`docs/research/10-agent-manipulation-and-mitigations/FINDINGS.md`](docs/research/10-agent-manipulation-and-mitigations/FINDINGS.md):

1. **Context Overloading & Context Flooding**:
   * *Mechanism*: Flooding the DOM with thousands of filler tokens, deeply nested dummy structures, or repetitive text.
   * *Impact*: Dilutes transformer attention ("lost in the middle"), pushes system instructions out of active attention range, and induces recency-bias prompt injection. Burns token quotas.
2. **Dummy DOM Diffs**:
   * *Mechanism*: Hostile JavaScript rapidly mutating irrelevant DOM attributes or invisible elements.
   * *Impact*: Traps agent diffing engines in infinite analysis loops, causing memory thrashing and action timeouts.
3. **The Rationalization Paradox (Dark Patterns on Agents)**:
   * *Mechanism*: DECEPTICON (ICLR 2026) proved agents are 2.3x more susceptible to dark patterns than humans (>70% vs 31%).
   * *Impact*: Larger models with reasoning (o1, Sonnet 3.7) over-rationalize deceptive cues (inventing justifications for "Best Value" traps).
4. **Visual vs. DOM Cloaking**:
   * Non-rendered text (~70% of real-world injections) targets text agents; typographic pixel injection targets Vision-Language Models.
5. **Interactive Traps & Delayed TOCTOU**:
   * Clickjacking transparent overlays; delayed injections triggered after initial security scan via `setTimeout` or scroll events.
6. **Agent Gaslighting / Synthetic Fault Injection & Tool Misattribution**:
   * *Mechanism*: Hostile pages induce simulated errors (fake "MCP Tool Error" or "Session Expired" DOM banners) or steal input focus during typing to deflect keystrokes into hidden sniffer fields.
   * *Impact*: Exploits the agent's ReAct self-correction loop. The agent misattributes the malfunction to its own tool or code, assumes responsibility, and follows hostile on-page remediation procedures (leaking credentials or granting elevated permissions).

## Detection Targets (Tiered Engine)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIER 1: FULLY STRUCTURAL CORE (Build First - High Evidence, 100% Deterministic)         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. Hidden / Invisible Instruction Content (Ingress)                                     |
|    - Drops display:none, visibility:hidden, opacity < 0.05, font-size: 0, off-screen,   |
|      zero-width Unicode, comments. Wipes out ~70% of real-world injection payloads.     |
| 2. Context Overloading & Dummy Diff Defense (Ingress)                                   |
|    - Enforces node budget (max 50 interactive elements per snapshot); compacts bloat.  |
| 3. Overlay / Hit-Target Mismatch (Egress)                                               |
|    - document.elementFromPoint(x, y). Blocks clickjacking overlays with opacity < 0.1.  |
| 4. Pre-Checked / Pre-Set Manipulative State (Form Audit)                                |
|    - Audits initial checked=true states on opt-ins and data-sharing toggles.            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIER 2: PARTIAL STRUCTURAL / FLOW TRACKING (Build Second if Time Permits)               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. Late-Appearing Drip Pricing: Track total price across navigation steps; flag deltas. |
| 6. Obstructed Cancellation: Measure step-depth and click asymmetry between sign-up/cancel|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIER 3: THE SEMANTIC CEILING (Requires Language Semantics - Advisory LLM / Jev Only)    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Confirmshaming, Double Negatives, Fake Urgency. Handled by advisory escalation.       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Research Ground Truth & Verified Numbers

* **Common Crawl Census (~1.2B URLs, ~24.8M hosts, Oct 2025)**: 15,300 validated prompt injections across 2,042 hosts (~0.008% of hosts). **~70% sit in non-rendered HTML** [A-09, A-10].
* **Real-World Incident**: Exactly **one** confirmed in-the-wild incident (Unit 42, Dec 2025: live site manipulating an AI ad-review pipeline) [A-14].
* **WASP Benchmark (Meta, NeurIPS 2025)**: Intermediate ASR (16-86%) vs End-to-End ASR (0-17%) proves "security by incompetence" [A-10].
* **DECEPTICON (Stanford, ICLR 2026)**: Dark patterns steer agents in **>70% of tasks** vs 31% human baseline. Susceptibility **scales with model size and reasoning budget** [DP-10].
* **Ersoy et al. (Purdue, accepted IEEE S&P 2026)**: Single-pattern susceptibility averaged **41.1%**; multi-pattern stacking increases harm by up to **+700% to +2300%** [DP-11].
* **Commercial Guardrail Bypasses (Hackett et al., 2025)**: Up to **100% evasion** on Azure Prompt Shield and Meta Prompt Guard [M-03].
* **ProtectAI Utility Collapse (2025)**: DeBERTa classifier reduced attacks to 7.95% but crashed legitimate task success from **83.0% down to 41.5%** [M-08].

## Benchmark: TrickyArena Live Matrix

We evaluate against the live hosted [TrickyArena](https://agenttrickydps.vercel.app) benchmark (Ersoy et al., IEEE S&P 2026).
* **Legal Notice**: `liteagent` repo has **no license**; we drive the public hosted Vercel site as a black-box target without copying their code.
* **Scoring Ground Truth**: Action-trace DOM click lookups (`dp_checks.py`), not financial transactions.

| # | Pattern Name | Code | Site | Detectability | Detection Mechanism |

## Current Active Work & Status Log

* **2026-09-25 08:35**: Created `docs/research/10-agent-manipulation-and-mitigations/FINDINGS.md` documenting context overloading, dummy DOM diffs, dark pattern cognitive mechanics, Jev model capabilities, and dual-filter MCP integration.
* **2026-09-25 08:40**: Codified the **Three-Pillar Product Vision** (Hardened MCP Tool + Cognitive Vigilance Skill + Sandboxed Subagent).
* **2026-09-25 08:45**: Cloned and inspected `external/liteagent` benchmark testbed and evaluation suite.
* **2026-09-25 11:00**: Configured `external/auto-browser` for native standalone execution without Docker; removed Docker files; enabled Playwright visible/headed browser mode.
* **2026-09-25 11:02**: Integrated `auto-browser` MCP with `agy` CLI (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`); verified built-in Operator Dashboard on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard` and artifact recording (`controller/data/artifacts/`).
* **2026-09-25 11:04**: Successfully executed E2E smoke test (`google.com` -> `amazon.com`) and live TrickyArena benchmark task (`https://agenttrickydps.vercel.app/shopping?dp=w` -> Dell Inspiron 15 rating lookup) with full action logging and screenshots.
* **2026-09-25 11:35**: Implemented independent **Live Per-Session Ephemeral Dashboard** (`/live/{session_id}` and `/sessions/{session_id}/dashboard`) with real-time SSE event bus streaming agent actions, responses, and S.H.O.A.V. security checks. Verified live connection and transition to archived state on session close.
* **2026-09-25 11:36**: Created universal agent documentation [`AGENTS.md`](file:///d:/work/genesishackathon/AGENTS.md), [`external/auto-browser/AGENTS.md`](file:///d:/work/genesishackathon/external/auto-browser/AGENTS.md), and `GEMINI.md`.
* **2026-09-25 (repo cleanup)**: Untracked and git-ignored `track3/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`. Only `external/.gitkeep` is tracked from `external/`, so the clones are never pushed. README now credits Auto Browser (modified locally) and LiteAgent (benchmark only, no license). Project `CLAUDE.md` rules (Python 3.10 default) override the 3.12 in the handoff notes. Docs get refreshed daily.
* **2026-09-25 (vendored Auto Browser)**: `external/auto-browser/` is now tracked (MIT, LICENSE kept, our local changes in their own commits; runtime data and `.env` excluded). `external/liteagent/` stays untracked: no license, so we do not redistribute it. LiteAgent's own runner needs its agents plus OpenAI keys, so instead we drive its hosted TrickyArena prompts with `agy` through Auto Browser (no Docker). Headless `agy` run on `shop?dp=w` was blocked by an unanswered `command` permission; needs an allow rule in agy settings or a permission decision.
* **2026-09-25 15:26**: Created `shoav-mcp/DETERMINISTIC_TARGETS.md` specifying purely computational dark pattern targets (opacity, clickjacking hit-test mismatch, pre-checked toggles, context bloat) separated from skill-based psychological patterns.
* **2026-09-25 15:30**: Created `shoav-mcp/filters/PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md` detailing the Ingress (ALLOW/BLOCK/REWRITE with telemetry) and Egress (ALLOW/BLOCK with elementFromPoint hit-testing) pipeline, JevEmbed local acceleration, and evaluating internal Auto-Browser modification vs. external proxy.
* **2026-09-25 17:25**: Analyzed and integrated **Agent Gaslighting & Tool Misattribution** into the S.H.O.A.V. architecture. Updated `shoav-mcp/filters/PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md` and `shoav-mcp/filters/context.md` with deterministic defenses: Ingress synthetic error quarantine and Egress post-action input/focus integrity verification.
* **2026-09-25 (evening)**: Deterministic ingress/egress filter core implemented in `shoav-mcp/filters/` (90 tests, JS probes verified in Chromium). Teammate shipped `shoav-skill/` (defense manual, audit scripts, npx installer) and the project report. Tracking moved from `external/auto-browser/` to `external/automcp/` (our reworked copy). Work pushed to `modules-parted-mcp-patch` as a backdated, staged history.
* **2026-09-26 (morning)**: Copied the reworked Auto Browser to `shoav-mcp/MCP/auto-browser/` and wired the guard into its gateway (`controller/app/guard/`, hooks in `tool_gateway/gateway.py`). Added `shoav-mcp/connectors/`, `shoav-mcp/fixtures/`, the `t5_e2e` runner, a CLI (`shoav-mcp/MCP/shoav/`) and agent templates. Fixed the live gaps (T1 rewrite marker, T2 actionable block, T3 submit escalation, egress counters). Measured: enforce 27/27, observe 17/17, off 22/22. Real `agy` runs confirmed hidden-text rewrite and overlay block. Report: `shoav-mcp/MCP/REPORT.md`.
* **2026-09-26 (late morning)**: Closed the last real-agent gap: a submit with an untouched pre-checked box is now held even if the agent never called observe (the gateway probes the live form itself). Research moved to `docs/research/`. README, AGENTS.md and DESIGN.md brought in line with the measured state.
* **Not done, on purpose**: full rename of the MCP server to SHOAV (server still reports as auto-browser), live mutation-rate feed, Claude Code as a measured client, iframe and Shadow DOM hit tests.
