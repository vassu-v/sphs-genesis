"""Thresholds for the deterministic filter core.

Every number here is a heuristic parameter, not a measured constant — the
literature review (research/08-synthesis/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, question 2) is
explicit that no false-positive rate has been measured for rules like these.
Keep them here, in one place, so they can be tuned from real test results
instead of being buried inline.
