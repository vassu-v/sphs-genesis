    Design refinement vs. PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md's rough sketch: that
    version blocks a *matching* element too if its own opacity happens to
    be low (`safe = isMatch && !isTransparentOverlay`), which would
    false-positive on a legitimately semi-transparent/mid-animation target

    always ALLOWs; the overlay check only applies to a *different* topmost
    element, which is the actual clickjacking shape. A non-match that
    doesn't look like a decoy (an ordinary visible element — e.g. a cookie
    banner appeared) gets ESCALATE rather than a hard BLOCK, since it may
    just mean the page changed under the agent, not an attack.
