"""Per-session memory for filter checks that need a T0 vs. T1 diff.

Ingress Target 3 (pre-checked form state) and egress Target 5 (cart
sneaking) are not decidable from a single observation — they need "what was
true when the page/cart first loaded" to diff against "what's true now".
The two design sketches in PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md and context.md treat
ingress/egress as stateless request->response filters and never say where
that T0 snapshot lives. This is that missing piece: an in-memory cache keyed
by session_id, since Auto Browser already hands us a session_id on every
call. No persistence, no eviction policy — a hackathon-weekend session
cache, not a production store.
