# S.H.O.A.V. Deterministic Filter Core (`shoav-mcp/filters/`)

**Status: independent core built and unit-tested. Not wired into any MCP yet — see "What's still open" below.**

This directory holds the deterministic (no-LLM) ingress/egress filter logic
for S.H.O.A.V. It is pure Python, zero third-party dependencies, and does
not touch `external/auto-browser` or any live browser. That's a deliberate
scoping choice, not an oversight — see "Why independent-first" below.

---

## 1. Research basis — what this is built on

Everything here traces back to prior work already in this repo, not new
research done while coding:

- **`research/04-mitigations/FINDINGS.md`** — establishes the core design
  thesis: deterministic/structural detection is well-precedented for
  hidden-text (PhantomLint), and an LLM must never be the sole/final gate,
  because LLM guards are themselves attackable through the content they
  inspect (up to 100% guardrail-evasion rates measured [M-03], JudgeDeceiver
  and Comparative Undermining Attack against LLM-as-judge [M-04][M-09]).
  That's why nothing in this package calls a model.
- **`research/08-synthesis/DETECTION_TARGETS.md`** and
  **`research/07-trickyarena/FINDINGS.md`** — the priority ranking (build
  the fully-structural targets first; explicitly skip confirmshaming,
  bait-and-switch, aesthetic manipulation — those need language
  understanding and are out of scope for this core by design, routed to
  the separate cognitive-vigilance skill instead).
- **`shoav-mcp/DETERMINISTIC_TARGETS.md`** — the exact 5-target spec this
  package implements against (table below).
- **`shoav-mcp/filters/context.md`** and **`PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md`** —
  the architectural decisions (Ingress ALLOW/REWRITE/BLOCK, Egress
  ALLOW/BLOCK/ESCALATE, the "unified adapter" pattern: pure core now,
  connectors later) and the original rough code sketches this package
  refines.
- **`research/06-autobrowser/FINDINGS.md`** and **`INTEGRATION.md`** — the
  actual Auto Browser payload shapes (`interactables`, `accessibility_outline`)
  the fixtures in `tests/fixtures.py` mirror, and the recommended
  interception points for when connectors get written.
- **`research/08-synthesis/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`** — the honesty constraint
  this whole package tries to respect: question 1 says structural detection
  against general deceptive UI is "plausible and partially precedented, not
  proven"; question 2 says no false-positive rate has been measured for
  rules like these. Nothing below claims otherwise — see "Known
  limitations."

## 2. Why independent-first

The user's design question was: build inside `external/auto-browser`
directly, or build the logic standalone and connect later? This package is
the answer already recommended in `PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md` §2 (the
"Unified Adapter Pattern"): write the detection/decision logic once as
plain Python functions over plain dicts, test it with fixtures shaped like
Auto Browser's real payloads, and only afterward write a thin connector
that feeds it live data. Nothing here imports Playwright, FastAPI, or
anything from `external/`.

## 3. Target coverage vs. `shoav-mcp/DETERMINISTIC_TARGETS.md`

| # | Target | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hidden/Invisible Text | **Done** — both halves: style-based (`find_hidden_textful_nodes`, needs the not-yet-wired `STYLE_PROBE_SCRIPT`) and text-based (`find_text_injections` — zero-width Unicode + comment/keyword scan, works from data Auto Browser already returns) | `ingress/rules.py` |
| 2 | Clickjacking & Overlays | **Done** — `evaluate_hit_test`, with one deliberate refinement over the original sketch (see §5) | `egress/rules.py` |
| 3 | Pre-Checked States | **Done** — `flag_prechecked_toggles` (ingress, at observation time) + `audit_form_state` (egress, at submission time). Works **today** from Auto Browser's existing `accessibility_outline` payload, whose AX nodes already carry a `checked` field — no new capability needed for this one | `ingress/rules.py`, `egress/rules.py` |
| 4 | Context Overloading & Dummy Diffs | **Done, three sub-checks**: node-count budget (`compact_node_budget`), text/token budget (`truncate_text_excerpt` — this was missing in the first pass, added after review, see §6), and a mutation-rate flood decision (`evaluate_mutation_rate`). The *decision* logic for all three is implemented; the mutation-rate *observation* (a live MutationObserver feed) is connector-layer work, not yet built | `ingress/rules.py`, `ingress/engine.py` |
| 5 | Cart Sneaking | **Done** — `diff_cart_state`, using the per-session state cache to hold the T0 cart snapshot | `egress/rules.py`, `session_state.py` |

All 5 targets from the spec have real logic and real test coverage. Nothing
was silently skipped. What's *not* covered is everything the research
explicitly put out of scope for the deterministic core (confirmshaming,
bait-and-switch, aesthetic manipulation, fake urgency) — those need
language understanding and were never meant to live here; they're the
cognitive-vigilance skill's job.

```

Design decisions worth flagging (not just "what," but "why," since some of
these diverge from the original rough sketches):

- **JS reports facts, Python decides.** The original sketch in
  `PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md` had the in-page JavaScript both inspect *and*
  mutate the DOM (`el.remove()`) in one pass, so Python only ever saw a
  count. `INTEGRATION.md` independently recommended the opposite —
  `style_probe` should report facts "WITHOUT pre-filtering... we want the
  invisible ones surfaced, not silently dropped." This package follows that
  recommendation: `scripts.py` only gathers facts; every decision (is this
  benign-hidden, is this a real injection) is in testable Python.
- **Benign-hidden allowlist.** `find_hidden_textful_nodes` skips
  `sr-only`/`visually-hidden`-style nodes instead of stripping everything
  hidden, because naive hidden=malicious over-fires on ordinary
  accessibility markup (a stated risk in `DETECTION_TARGETS.md` Target 1).
- **Keyword-gated pre-checked-toggle flagging.** Only `checkbox`/`toggle`/
  `switch` types are eligible (never `radio`/`select`, which usually need
  *some* default), and only when the label matches a consent/marketing/
  add-on keyword list — otherwise a "remember me" default or a required
  shipping-method radio would false-positive on every ordinary commercial
  site.
- **Egress ESCALATE, not just BLOCK.** The design defines three egress
  verdicts, but the original hit-test sketch only ever produced two. Here,
  a topmost-element mismatch only **BLOCK**s when it looks like an actual
  decoy (near-zero opacity or absurd z-index); an ordinary, visible,
  different element on top (e.g. a cookie banner that genuinely just
  appeared) gets **ESCALATE** instead — it might mean the page changed
  under the agent, not that it's under attack.

## 5. Tests — what they check and how to run them

37 tests, stdlib `unittest` (no `pytest` installed in this environment; no
pip install needed either way — matches the project's own "zero
dependencies for the deterministic core" philosophy from
`PLAN_AND_ROUGH_SKETCH.md` §4).

```bash
cd shoav-mcp && python3 -m unittest discover -s filters/tests -t . -v
```

`tests/fixtures.py` is the important file to read first: it's data shaped
like Auto Browser's **real** payloads — `interactables` entries look like
`INTERACTABLES_SCRIPT`'s output (`{element_id, tag, type, role, label,
bbox}`), `accessibility_outline.nodes` entries look like Playwright's
native `accessibility.snapshot()` nodes — per what
`research/06-autobrowser/FINDINGS.md` documented from the actual source.
That's what testing "against the MCP's own internal data types" means with
no live browser available: fixtures shaped like the real thing, not an
invented format.

Every rule is tested with **both** an attack case and a false-positive
trap in the same test, not just the happy path:

| Rule | Attack case | False-positive trap it must NOT fire on |
|---|---|---|
| hidden-textful nodes | injected `display:none` instruction node | `sr-only` skip-link span |
| pre-checked toggles | "share my data with marketing partners" | "remember me" checkbox, shipping-method radio |
| hit-test | near-zero-opacity high-z-index overlay | a legitimate different element genuinely on top (→ ESCALATE, not BLOCK) |
| focus integrity | value typed into a hidden decoy field | — (exact-match by design, see §6) |
| cart diff | item appears with no logged add-click | item appears whose click *was* logged |
| node/token budget | 750-node flood page | 10-node ordinary page (no-op) |

`test_session_state.py` covers the cache itself (same-session identity,
cross-session isolation, mutation persistence, reset) — this had zero
coverage in the first pass and was added after re-review (§6).

## 6. Known limitations — read this before trusting any of it

Being direct about this, per the project's own "report-safety" norm
(`research/09-verification-closeout/CLOSEOUT.md`) and because it was asked
directly: **no**, this is not the complete wired thing yet, and yes, it has
real, documented gaps — not bugs that crash it (all 37 tests pass), but
scope and design limitations worth knowing before demoing it:

1. **Nothing here has executed against a real browser.** `scripts.py`'s JS
   strings are written but never run. Every test feeds pre-computed fixture
   data standing in for what that JS *would* return. This is real, but it
   is simulated-real, not live-verified.
2. **The mutation-rate flood check has a decision function
   (`evaluate_mutation_rate`) but no observation mechanism.** A per-second
   rate isn't a single `page.evaluate()` call, it's a subscription over
   time — that's connector-layer work, explicitly not started.
3. **Pre-checked-toggle refs are a real correlation weakness.** Playwright's
   native `accessibility.snapshot()` nodes (what Auto Browser's
   `accessibility_outline` actually returns, per `FINDINGS.md` §1a) have no
   stable element id — this package uses the accessible **name/label
   text** as a pseudo-ref. That's fine for flagging ("this toggle looks
   pre-checked") but fragile for later re-identifying the exact same
   control to let the agent un-check it (two controls with identical
   labels would collide). Wiring this properly likely means correlating
   against the separate `interactables` list by bounding-box proximity, or
   getting Auto Browser's AX-tree output extended with a stable ref — an
   open integration question, not something fixable in this pure layer.
4. **Focus-integrity value comparison is exact-string.** A legitimate
   autocomplete/autofill that alters the typed value slightly could produce
   a false BLOCK. A fuzzy/prefix match would reduce this but adds its own
   tuning surface — left as exact-match deliberately rather than guessing
   at a fuzz threshold with no data to tune it against.
5. **Every threshold is a heuristic parameter, not a measured one** — this
   is the literature's own stated gap (`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` #2), not
   something this package resolves. They're collected in `constants.py`
   specifically so they can be tuned once real false-positive/attack data
   exists, instead of guessed once and forgotten.
6. **Keyword lists (injection phrases, consent keywords) are pattern
   matching, not language understanding.** Documented in `constants.py`
   itself: a paraphrased injection or a consent toggle with unrelated
   wording will slip through. This is intentional scope, not a bug — that
   gap belongs to the semantic/skill layer, not the deterministic core.
7. **The `eval_js` governance question from the design discussion is still
   open.** Auto Browser requires `workflow_profile=governed` (with a human-
   approval gate) for `eval_js`, the tool that would run `scripts.py`'s
   JS today. Not blocking for this layer, since nothing here calls it yet
   — but it's the first thing to resolve when writing the proxy connector.

## 7. Next version — connectors

The whole point of building this independently was to defer the
integration decision, not skip it. Two connectors, not written yet:

- **`shoav-mcp/connectors/gateway_patch.py`** — an in-process wrapper
  around `McpToolGateway.call_tool()` inside `external/auto-browser`. Calls
  `session.page.evaluate()` directly, bypassing the `eval_js`
  governed-approval gate entirely since it never goes through that tool
  call. The internals work you're doing separately is exactly what this
  connector will eventually sit on top of.
- **`shoav-mcp/connectors/proxy_adapter.py`** — an external stdio/HTTP MCP
  proxy in front of Auto Browser, for running the guard against a stock,
  unmodified install. Needs the `eval_js` auto-approve dance (call → 409 →
  self-approve via `browser.approve_approval` → retry) worked out first.

Neither connector is needed to keep developing or testing the core in
`ingress/` and `egress/` — they're additive, wired in whenever the Auto
Browser internals side is ready.
