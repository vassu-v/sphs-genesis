## Public launch checklist

### Pre-launch (do before going public)

- [ ] review README top section
- [ ] verify license and contribution docs exist
- [ ] confirm `.env` and data dirs are ignored
- [ ] run `make release-audit`
- [ ] record demo GIF: login → human takeover → save auth profile → reopen session
- [ ] embed GIF in README (above the fold, before quickstart)
- [ ] verify no secrets in git history for this branch
- [ ] prepare first 3 “good first issue” tickets (see `docs/good-first-issues.md`)
- [ ] create GitHub release `v1.2.1` with changelog
- [ ] add GitHub topics: `mcp`, `browser-automation`, `playwright`, `llm`, `claude`, `ai-agent`, `self-hosted`, `local-first`, `fastapi`, `docker`

### Day 1 launch (same day, in order)

- [ ] post Show HN — title: `Show HN: Auto Browser – open-source MCP browser agent with human takeover`
- [ ] post to r/LocalLLaMA
- [ ] post to Anthropic Discord `#show-and-tell` channel
- [ ] post X/Twitter thread with demo GIF
- [ ] submit PR to `awesome-mcp-servers` (https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)

### Day 2–7

- [ ] respond to every issue and comment within 24 hours
- [ ] publish one technical post: “How I built persistent browser auth profiles for AI agents” or “Why browser agents need a human takeover button”
