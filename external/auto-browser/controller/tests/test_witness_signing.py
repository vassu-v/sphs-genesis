"""Witness receipts must be attributable, not merely self-consistent.

Before signing, the chain was SHA-256 linked and nothing else: anyone holding
the JSONL could edit a receipt, recompute every downstream hash, and produce a
chain that `verify()` passed. The receipts proved nothing to anyone outside the
box that wrote them.

These tests pin the properties that make a bundle evidence:
  * a tampered receipt fails the hash chain
  * a *consistently re-hashed* tampered chain — the forgery the old design could
    not detect — still fails on signatures
  * an exported bundle verifies with the standalone script, which imports
    nothing from this project
