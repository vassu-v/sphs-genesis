![Auto Browser demo](docs/assets/demo.gif)

> **Give your AI agent a real browser, with a human in the loop.**

Auto Browser is an MCP-native browser control plane for authorized workflows. It gives MCP clients, LLM agents, and operators a shared Playwright browser with human takeover, reusable auth profiles, approvals, audit trails, and local-first deployment.

Works with:

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- any MCP client that can talk HTTP or stdio
- direct REST callers when you want curl-first control

## Why Auto Browser

- **MCP-native from day one.** The browser surface is already packaged as an MCP server instead of bolted on after the fact.
- **Human takeover when the web gets brittle.** noVNC keeps the same live session available when a person needs to step in.
- **Login once, reuse later.** Save named auth profiles and reopen fresh sessions that are already signed in.
- **Local-first by default.** Run the full stack on your own box with Docker Compose, or use Codespaces for a quick hosted demo.
- **Safety rails built in.** Approvals, operator identity, PII scrubbing, Witness receipts, and policy presets are all part of the product surface.
- **Evidence you can hand to someone else.** Witness receipt chains are Ed25519-signed, and an exported bundle verifies with [`scripts/verify_witness_bundle.py`](./scripts/verify_witness_bundle.py) — which imports nothing from this project, so a recipient need not run or trust this controller to check it.
- **We audit ourselves in public.** [`docs/audits/2026-08-execution-audit.md`](./docs/audits/2026-08-execution-audit.md) documents an adversarial audit of this repo that found safety controls which reported success while doing nothing, with reproductions, the fixes, and the gates that close the class.
- **Governed skill induction.** Verified browser traces can become staged skill candidates with provenance that is signed when a mesh identity is configured — and checked on read, not just produced — plus verifier adapters and review-only graduation — agents that prove they can repeat themselves correctly, not just act once.

## Release Highlights (v1.5.0)

- **Read a page without paying for pixels.** The new `text` observation preset returns the accessibility outline, extracted text, and interactables with no screenshot and no OCR — the cheapest way for an agent to read a page. Set `PERCEPTION_PRESET_DEFAULT=text` to make it a deployment-wide default.
- **Find a string on the page in one call.** `browser.find_elements` now takes a `query` (plain text or regex, case-insensitive) instead of a CSS selector and returns each match with surrounding context — no full observe needed to check one value.
- **Errors agents can act on.** Invalid tool arguments report field-level details, handler messages pass through instead of a generic failure, and the MCP bridge's cold-start error now says exactly how to start the controller.
- **Any OpenAI-compatible model can drive the browser.** A single generic adapter serves every model reachable over an OpenAI `/chat/completions` endpoint. New providers: `openrouter` (one key → ~every frontier model), `xai` (Grok), `deepseek`, `minimax`, and `openai_compatible` (custom base URL for self-hosted Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio, Azure, Together, Groq, Fireworks, …). Vision + function-calling with a content-parse fallback for endpoints that ignore `tool_choice`.
- **`browser://audit/events` MCP resource.** List and read recent audit events across sessions directly over MCP.
- **Playwright pin parity enforced in CI.** The controller (pip) and browser-node (npm) Playwright versions must match exactly — a single-side bump can no longer merge and crash-loop compose deployments.
- **On PyPI.** `pip install auto-browser-client` for the SDK, `pip install auto-browser-langchain` for the LangChain/LangGraph/CrewAI adapters, and `uvx auto-browser-mcp` to run the MCP stdio bridge with zero setup. Releases publish via PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC) on tag push.

### Since v1.3.0
- **`browser_manager.py` is now a pure facade + composition root** (1,284 → 769 lines), with domain logic extracted into `app/browser/services/`.
- **Fork state exports are encrypted at rest** and shadow-browse state never touches disk.
- **Download capture tasks can no longer be garbage-collected mid-flight**, shadow-browse failures roll back cleanly, and page listeners survive object-id reuse.
- **Release gates in CI** enforce dependency audits, fixture evals, client tests, Python wheel builds, and the 80% controller coverage gate on Python 3.11 and 3.14.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history.

## Good Fits

- internal dashboards and admin tools
- operator-assisted QA and browser debugging
- login-once, reuse-later account workflows
- brittle sites where a human may need to recover the flow
- MCP-powered agent workflows that need a real browser, not just HTML fetches

## Not the Goal

- CAPTCHA solving
- unauthorized scraping or account automation
- deceptive identity shaping or bypass tooling

## What You Get

| Browser Control | Operator Safety | Deployment and Integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Playwright-backed sessions with screenshots, DOM summaries, OCR excerpts, tab controls, downloads, and network inspection | approval gates, operator identity headers, audit events, PII scrubbing, Witness receipts, and protection profiles | MCP over HTTP, bundled stdio bridge, REST API, Docker Compose, Codespaces, auth profiles, and optional per-session isolation |

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LvcidPsyche/auto-browser.git
cd auto-browser
docker compose up --build
```

That is enough for local development with the default settings.

Optional:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make doctor
```

Run `make doctor` from a normal terminal with local Docker access and permission to open localhost sockets.

Open:

- API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Operator dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard`
- Visual takeover: `http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&resize=scale`

All published ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.

## Try It in Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/LvcidPsyche/auto-browser?quickstart=1)

Codespaces provisions the stack automatically. The dashboard and noVNC tabs are usually ready in about 90 seconds.

## First Useful Demo

The highest-signal flow in this repo is:

1. create a session
2. log in manually if the site needs a human
3. save the session as a named auth profile
4. open a new session from that auth profile
5. continue work without reauthing

Start here:

- [`examples/login-and-save-profile.md`](./examples/login-and-save-profile.md)
- [`examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md)

Minimal session creation:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/sessions \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"demo","start_url":"https://example.com"}' | jq
```

Minimal observation:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/sessions/<session-id>/observe | jq
```

## MCP Clients

Auto Browser exposes:

- an HTTP MCP endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`
- convenience endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools` and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools/call`
- a stdio bridge: `uvx auto-browser-mcp` from PyPI, or [`scripts/mcp_stdio_bridge.py`](./scripts/mcp_stdio_bridge.py) in a repo checkout

The default MCP tool profile is `curated`, which keeps the browser surface compact for better tool selection. If you want the full internal tool surface, set:

```bash
MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=full
```

Raw tool-call example:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/tools/call \
  -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name":"browser.create_session",
    "arguments":{
      "name":"demo",
      "start_url":"https://example.com"
    }
  }' | jq
```

## Convergence Harness

Auto Browser ships a Stage 0 convergence harness for Agent Skill Induction. It runs a structured task contract, records tamper-checked traces, verifies completion, and writes a staged skill candidate carrying provenance. With a mesh identity configured that provenance is signed, and the registry verifies the signature before serving a candidate — a candidate that fails the check, or that was dropped into the staging directory unsigned, is refused. Candidates induced from a mock run are marked `simulated` so they cannot pass as converged. Generated skills are staged only — promotion stays explicit and reviewed.

Read-only inspection tools (`harness.list_runs`, `harness.get_status`, `harness.get_trace`) are exposed in the default `curated` MCP tool profile so agents can introspect harness state without elevated access. Convergence runs, drift checks, candidate management, and graduation require `MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=full`, or can be invoked directly over REST.

Start with [`docs/convergence-harness.md`](./docs/convergence-harness.md). A deterministic local smoke is:

```bash
python -m controller.harness.run --contract evals/contracts/example_read.json --mock-final-url https://example.com --mock-final-text "Example Domain"
```

For MCP clients, set `MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=full` to expose the `harness.*` tools.

## Security and Compliance

For a real private deployment, set at least:

```bash
APP_ENV=production
API_BIND_SCOPE=exposed
API_BEARER_TOKEN=<strong-random-secret>
REQUIRE_OPERATOR_ID=true
AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<44-char-fernet-key>
REQUIRE_AUTH_STATE_ENCRYPTION=true
REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
METRICS_ENABLED=true
STEALTH_ENABLED=false
```

`COMPLIANCE_TEMPLATE` can apply a preconfigured posture at startup:

| Preset | Auth Encryption | Operator ID | PII Scrub | Isolation | Max Session Age |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `strict` | required | required | all layers | `docker_ephemeral` | 4h |
| `balanced` | - | required | network + text | shared | 24h |

Both presets require upload approvals and enable Witness receipts. Startup writes the applied policy to `/data/compliance-manifest.json`. The legacy names (`HIPAA`, `SOC2`, `GDPR`, `PCI-DSS`) still work as deprecated aliases and emit a warning at startup.

Example:

```bash
COMPLIANCE_TEMPLATE=strict docker compose up
```

### Model providers

First-class adapters for **OpenAI**, **Claude**, and **Gemini** (API or CLI). Beyond those,
a single generic **OpenAI-compatible** adapter drives any model reachable over an OpenAI
`/chat/completions` endpoint — set an API key to enable it:

| Provider | Reaches |
|----------|---------|
| `openrouter` | one key → ~every frontier model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, Qwen, …) |
| `xai` | Grok |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek (text-only; driven from the DOM/accessibility outline) |
| `minimax` | MiniMax |
| `openai_compatible` | any custom base URL — self-hosted Ollama / vLLM / LM Studio, Azure OpenAI, Together, Groq, Fireworks, … |

Vision (screenshots) is used for every provider except text-only ones. See `.env.example` for
the `*_API_KEY` / `*_BASE_URL` / `*_MODEL` settings.

Core components:

- `browser-node/` runs Chromium, Xvfb, x11vnc, and noVNC
- `controller/` exposes the FastAPI controller, MCP transport, policy rails, and orchestration endpoints
- `data/` holds runtime artifacts, auth state, approvals, audit logs, and optional CLI caches
- `scripts/` contains local helpers for doctor, smoke tests, bridges, and release checks
