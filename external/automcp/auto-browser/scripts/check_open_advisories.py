"""Block a release while a privately reported advisory sits unacknowledged.

GHSA-xmh3-cw7j-9gp5 arrived through GitHub private vulnerability reporting on
2026-06-17 and sat in `triage` for seven weeks. Nothing surfaced it: a private
report appears in neither the issue list, the pull-request list, nor anything a
maintainer routinely opens, and it was found only by listing advisories through
the API while publishing an unrelated one. Meanwhile SECURITY.md promises to
"acknowledge reports quickly".

The fix has to attach to a process that is guaranteed to happen. Cutting a
release is the only one, so the check lives in the release audit: a report still
in `triage` means nobody has accepted it, and shipping past that is how seven
weeks happen.

`draft` advisories are reported but do not block — accepted-and-being-fixed is a
legitimate place to be mid-release.
