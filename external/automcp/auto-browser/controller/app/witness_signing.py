"""Ed25519 signing for witness receipt chains.

The receipt chain was SHA-256 linked but unsigned, which meant it detected
*accidental* corruption and nothing else: anyone holding the JSONL could edit a
receipt, recompute every downstream hash, and produce a chain that verified
perfectly. Receipts proved nothing to anyone outside the box that wrote them.

Signing each receipt's `chain_hash` fixes that. Because `chain_hash` already
covers the entire preceding chain, a signature over it attests to both the
receipt and its whole history up to that point.

Deliberately not solved here — state it rather than let a reader assume it:

* **Tail truncation.** Dropping the last k receipts leaves a shorter chain whose
  every signature is still valid — signing cannot see it at all. Since 1.7.0 an
  anchor file kept beside each chain records the head hash and receipt count on
  every append, and `verify()` compares the two, so truncation is detected
  without any third party (`app/witness_anchor.py`). An attacker who rewrites the
  anchor along with the chain still defeats it: that is what a genuinely
  *external* anchor — a published head, a countersigning peer — is for, and the
  anchor is a separate artifact precisely so one can be shipped elsewhere.
  `verify()` also still reports the signed head for a caller holding a
  previously published one.
* **Key compromise.** A holder of the private key can rewrite history and
  re-sign it. This raises the bar from "anyone with the file" to "anyone with
  the key", which is the point, but it is not tamper-proof storage.
