# Roadmap

This is the near-term direction for Auto Browser.

## Now (current in v1.6.0)

- Ed25519-signed Witness receipt chains — each receipt attests to itself and its whole history, and an exported bundle verifies anywhere via `scripts/verify_witness_bundle.py`, which imports nothing from this project
- `text` observation preset — accessibility outline, extracted text, and interactables with no screenshot and no OCR
- text/regex `query` mode on `browser.find_elements` — locate a string on the page without a full observe
- any OpenAI-compatible model can drive the browser (OpenRouter, xAI, DeepSeek, MiniMax, custom base URL for Ollama / vLLM / Azure / Groq, …)
- PyPI packages: `auto-browser-client` SDK, `auto-browser-langchain` adapters, `uvx auto-browser-mcp` stdio bridge
- stable local-first browser control
- reusable auth profiles + import/export
- human takeover via noVNC
- approvals and audit trails
- Witness receipts with on-demand hash-chain verification and Ed25519 signatures (REST + MCP), plus third-party-verifiable evidence bundles
- MCP transport + REST API with 70+ tools (curated and full profiles)
- Docker-based isolated session mode with orphan reaping and resource limits
- Stage 0 convergence harness for governed skill induction
- CDP connect mode — attach to an existing Chrome
- Network inspector — request/response capture with PII scrubbing
- PII scrubbing layer — pixel redaction, console, network (16 pattern classes)
- Proxy partitioning — named proxy personas for per-agent IPs
- Shadow browsing — flip headless → headed for live debugging
- Session forking — clone auth state into a new branch session
- Playwright script export — session replay as runnable .py
- Shared session links — HMAC-signed TTL observer tokens
- Vision-grounded targeting — Claude Vision element identification
- Cron + webhook triggers — autonomous scheduled jobs
- MCP Resources Protocol — live browser state as subscribable resources, with `resources/subscribe` and `notifications/resources/updated` pushed over the event stream
- Operator dashboard at `/dashboard` with SSE event stream
- Durable background-agent checkpoints with dashboard resume/discard/cancel controls
- Repeatable agent eval harness for provider and workflow-profile comparisons
- Local HTML fixture evals for release-critical browser workflows

## Next

- cleaner multi-tab / popup management
- stronger trace viewer integration in operator dashboard (the API already returns a `viewer_url`; the dashboard does not surface it yet)

## Recently Shipped

- v1.6.0 Ed25519-signed Witness chains and exportable, independently verifiable evidence bundles
- v1.5.1–v1.5.3 an adversarial execution audit of this repo and its fixes — several safety controls were asserted but never verified end to end, and three silently did nothing while reporting success. Findings, reproductions and the gates that close the class are in [`docs/audits/2026-08-execution-audit.md`](./docs/audits/2026-08-execution-audit.md)
- v1.5.0 `text` observation preset, `find_elements` query mode, actionable MCP tool errors, and an MCP stdio bridge cold-start fix that names the endpoint and the remedy
- v1.4.x whole-repo quality gates, nine-string version parity enforcement, `auto-browser-langchain` test coverage from zero to 94%, and the Python 3.14 `asyncio.get_event_loop()` fix
- v1.4.0 generic OpenAI-compatible provider adapter (OpenRouter / xAI / DeepSeek / MiniMax / custom base URL), `browser://audit/events` MCP resource, and a CI guard for Playwright pin parity
- v1.3.x operator dashboard run replay, auth-profile setup wizard, `browser_manager` facade refactor, encrypted fork-state exports, and fixture proof layers
- v1.2.1 PyPI publishing: client SDK, LangChain adapters, and the `auto-browser-mcp` bridge via tag-triggered trusted publishing
- v1.2.0 witness chain verification, isolated-container resource limits + orphan reaping, dependency refresh, and unified UA pool
- v1.1.x policy presets (`strict`/`balanced`), per-session isolation audit + CI smoke, dependency-audit gates, and the 80% coverage gate
- v1.0.1 security hardening, auth-profile archive fixes, client SDK repair, and dashboard XSS cleanup
- v1.0.4 governed approval enforcement, default-off social/Veo3 surfaces, default-off stealth, broader eval coverage, and release audit hardening
- v1.0.5 extracted social/Veo3 from the shipped controller wheel, added fixture evals, and raised controller coverage to 80%
- Durable background-agent checkpoints with REST/MCP resume support
- Request-level `fast` and `governed` workflow profiles for agent runs
- Agent memory profiles for cross-session context persistence
- Deployment readiness advisor with compliance mode checks
- Policy presets (`strict`, `balanced`) via a single env var, with deprecated aliases for prior names
- GitHub Codespaces one-click demo environment
- LangChain / LangGraph / CrewAI integration package
- Timing-safe bearer token comparison
- Haiku as the default vision targeting model

## Later

- richer workflow recipes and app-specific helpers
- hosted control plane
- enterprise deployment support
- stronger remote access ergonomics
- session recording / replay with step-level time travel

## Explicit non-goals

Auto Browser is not being built as:
- a stealth browser
- an anti-bot bypass tool
- a CAPTCHA solver
- an unauthorized scraping framework

## Product direction

The open-source core should be excellent on its own.

If the project commercializes later, the likely path is:
- hosted runners
- managed auth/session storage
- team features
- enterprise deployment/support
